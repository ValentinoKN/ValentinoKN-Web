Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
industry's dummy text ever since the 1500's, when an
unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum Web
content is dominated by the "page" concept, its
beginnings is an academic setting, and in a setting
dominated by type-written pages, the idea of the web
was to link from one academic paper to another
academic paper. This was a completely revolutionary
idea in the late 1980s and early 1990s when the best
a link could be made was to cite a reference in the
midst of a type written paper and name that
reference either at the bottom of the page or on the
last page of the academic paper. When it was possible
for any person to write and own a Mosaic page, the
concept of a "home page" blurred the idea of a page.
[2] It was possible for anyone to own a "Web page" or
a "home page" which in many cases the website
contained many physical pages in spite of being called
"a page". People often cited their "home page" to
provide credentials, links to anything that a person
supported, or any other individual content a person
wanted to publish.
